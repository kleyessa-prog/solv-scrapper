# Patient Form Data Capture

A Python-based Playwright script that monitors the Solvhealth queue page and automatically captures patient form data when forms are submitted.

## Purpose

This project captures patient form data in real-time when the "Add Patient" form is submitted on the Solvhealth management portal. It automatically:

- Monitors for form submissions
- Captures all form field data (name, phone, DOB, reason for visit, etc.)
- Tracks EMR ID assignment from API responses
- Saves data to JSON file and PostgreSQL database

## Features

- **Real-time Form Monitoring**: Automatically detects when patient forms are submitted
- **Complete Data Capture**: Captures all form fields including:
  - Legal first name and last name
  - Mobile phone
  - Date of birth
  - Reason for visit
  - Sex at birth
  - Location information
- **EMR ID Tracking**: Monitors API responses to capture EMR IDs when assigned
- **Data Storage**: Saves to both JSON file (`patient_data.json`) and PostgreSQL database
- **Location Management**: Supports multiple locations via location mapping

## Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Install Playwright browsers:**

```bash
playwright install chromium
```

3. **Set up database (optional):**

Create a `.env` file with database credentials:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=solvhealth_patients
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Then run the database schema:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d solvhealth_patients -f db_schema.sql
```

## Usage

### Quick Start - Run Everything Together

**Run both the monitor and API server simultaneously:**

```bash
export SOLVHEALTH_QUEUE_URL="https://manage.solvhealth.com/queue?location_ids=AXjwbE"
python run_all.py
```

This will:
1. Start the API server on `http://localhost:8000`
2. Start the patient form monitor
3. Both run concurrently and can be stopped with Ctrl+C

### Basic Usage - Monitor Only

Run the form monitor (opens browser window):

```bash
python monitor_patient_form.py
```

The script will:
1. Open a browser window and navigate to the Solvhealth queue page
2. Set up form monitoring
3. Wait for you to submit patient forms
4. Automatically capture and save form data when forms are submitted

### Instructions

1. Click 'Add Patient' button (modal will open)
2. Select location from dropdown in the modal
3. Fill out the form fields that appear
4. Click 'Add' button to submit
5. Form data will be captured and saved automatically

## Output

### JSON File

Patient data is saved to `patient_data.json` in JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "location_id": "AXjwbE",
    "location_name": "Exer Urgent Care - Demo",
    "legalFirstName": "John",
    "legalLastName": "Doe",
    "mobilePhone": "(555) 123-4567",
    "dob": "01/15/1990",
    "reasonForVisit": "General checkup",
    "sexAtBirth": "Male",
    "emr_id": "12345",
    "captured_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00"
  }
]
```

### Database

If configured, data is also saved to PostgreSQL database in the `patients` table.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Playwright for Python
- PostgreSQL (optional, for database storage)
- psycopg2-binary (optional, for database support)

## Configuration

### Location

**Required**: The location must be specified via the `SOLVHEALTH_QUEUE_URL` environment variable with a `location_ids` parameter:

```bash
export SOLVHEALTH_QUEUE_URL="https://manage.solvhealth.com/queue?location_ids=AXjwbE"
python3 monitor_patient_form.py
```

The script will extract the `location_ids` parameter from the URL. See `locations.py` for all available locations.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Browser not opening**: Make sure Playwright browsers are installed with `playwright install chromium`
2. **Form data not captured**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. **Database errors**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and credentials in `.env` are correct
4. **EMR ID not captured**: EMR IDs are captured from API responses; they may take a few seconds to appear
